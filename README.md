# NextJS project set up to use Sanity Presentation Mode

The presentation feature from Sanity allows for live updating of the site that is attached to the content, which is really neat. 
This is JUST the NextJS integration, as its diffiult to have a generic Sanity project. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
